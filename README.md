The REEPS (Rare Earth Element recovery from Phosphogypsum System) repository is a python based simulation tool for understanding the profitability (by TEA) and environmental impact (by LCA) of various process schemes. This work leverages existing python packages (e.g., biosteam, qsdsan, brightway2) in order to simulate the system and evaluate the sustainability under uncertainty for two different functional units (kg REO and kg PG remediated). Functionality includes chemical process simulation, TEA, LCA, uncertainty, sensitivity, and data science for interpretation. Future work includes evaluating new process schemes and setting research targets.
